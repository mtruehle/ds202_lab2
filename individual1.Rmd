hist(choco$Rating, main = 'Histogram of Chocolate Ratings', xlab = 'Rating')
boxplot(choco$Rating)

# By looking at both the histogram and the boxplot, I can conclude that it is a normal distribution with an outlier at 5 and a few oultiers near the bottom.
```

# 2: Do ratings depend on the cocao percentage of a chocolate bar?
cor(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct)
# By getting a correlation value that is close to zero, I can conclude that the ratings of the chocolate do not depnd on the cocao percentage.
