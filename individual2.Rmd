# 1: How are the ratings distributed? Plot a histogram of the ratings and describe.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, main='Chocolate Ratings Histogram', xlab='Rating')
```

# This is a normal distribution and there a few outliers around 1 and 5

# 2: Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?
```{r}
cor(choco$Rating, choco$Cocoa.Pct)
```

# [1] -0.1618855
# The ratings do not depend on the cocoa percentage of the chocolate bar because the correlation value is very close to 0.
